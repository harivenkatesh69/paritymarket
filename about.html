                <P>Your About Us page should be:

Informative.<br> It doesn’t always have to tell the whole story, but it should at least provide people with an idea of who and what you are.<br>
Contain social proof, testimonials, and some personal information that viewers can relate to such as education, family, etc.<br>
Useful and engaging.<br>
Easy to navigate and accessible on any device.<br>
That may all sound complicated, but it really isn’t.<br>

The main purpose of your About Us page is to give visitors a glimpse into the identity of either a person or business.<br>

As users discover your brand, they need to distinguish what sets you apart and makes you… you.<br>

This often requires finding the right balance between compelling content and a design carefully planned to look the part.<br>
